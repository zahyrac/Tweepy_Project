# Tweepy_Project
The goal of this project was to use the Tweepy program to crawl tweets for specific products of interest and conduct product analysis using Twitter.

Keep in mind that in order to run the code and to be able to send your request to the Twitter API, you need to have a developer twitter account and Generate the four Authorized keys.Â
